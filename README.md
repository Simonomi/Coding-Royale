# Coding-Royale
## Game explanation
A battle royale game in which the objective is to finish a series of short chalanges. Each challenge is to debug a small program, when a challenge is completed, the player moves on to the next challenge. The goal is to finish all challenges before any other players. The more players the more fun!

## Client
Just download and run the .exe file in the Releases page and fill out the blanks (IP is that of the server). To reset the current file, stop/start again. Stopping (Including finishing the game) will now automatically delete all previous challenges. **Note: Useless without a server**

## Server
For the server, just run the .exe file in Releases and it should set itself up. You must have at least one working challenge pack (_.chp_ file) in the same directory.

## Challenge packs
Soon I'm going to add a challenge pack creater, currently it's difficult to make your own challenge packs, but if you want to, you can use the Default.chp for reference. Note: do not use *name* anywhere in your challenge packs or it will not work properly.

### Note: Built for Windows 10

## Probable future changes
1. Challenge pack creator
