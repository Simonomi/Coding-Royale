# Coding-Royale
## Game explanation
A battle royale game in which the objective is to finish a series of short chalanges. Each challenge is to debug a small program, when a challenge is completed, all other players recieve a pentalty (a series of forced keystrokes). The goal is to finish all challenges before any other players. The more players the more fun!

## Client
Just download and run the .exe file in the Releases page and fill out the blanks (IP is that of server). **Note: Useless without a server, delete java files manually.**
## Server
For the server, just run the .py file in Releases, should run and set itself up.
## Challenge packs
Soon I'm going to add a challenge pack creater, currently it's difficult to make your own challenge packs, but if you want to, you can use the Default.chp for reference.
### Note: Built for Windows 10

## Possible future changes
1. Client.exe delete java files (from game only)
